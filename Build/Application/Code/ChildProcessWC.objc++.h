/*!
The type of block that can be installed to perform an
operation when the child process exit has been detected.
Even if the proxy window "close" method is used, an
attempt will first be made to force the child to exit
and this block will only be invoked when the "terminated"
state has been observed.

typedef void (^ChildProcessWC_AtExitBlockType)();



/*!
Implements a local proxy window (typically offscreen) that
intercepts window actions and translates them into calls
to a sub-process.  The sub-process, in turn, performs
equivalent actions in the graphical interface that is
displayed by the sub-process.  The assumption is that the
sub-process sets LSUIElement "true" and displays exactly
one main window.

This class helps to give the illusion of a continuous
window rotation, even though technically some windows in
the “rotation” belong to different processes.  As the user
rotates through windows, the proxy (when selected) will
switch to the sub-process automatically and skip itself in
the rotation.

The proxy should be constructed in a way that is consistent
with the type of interface in the child process.  Currently
there is only one option (a basic document-style window)
but that may change.

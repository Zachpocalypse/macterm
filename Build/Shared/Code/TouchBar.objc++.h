/*!
Allows the NSTouchBar to be specified in a separate
file and loaded only when the runtime supports it.

For simplicity, properties can be set on this class
to determine how the Touch Bar is initialized when it
is first loaded (setting default item identifiers,
etc.).  This is also the only way to make settings
when the SDK version is lower than the runtime.

The Touch Bar interface in the NIB should generally
be configured to send commands to the first responder.

The view is unused; it just simplifies NIB loading.

Note that this is only in the header for the sake of
Interface Builder, which will not synchronize with
changes to an interface declared in a ".mm" file.

This subclass is a hack to work around the fact that
NIB-provided color picker items do not work unless
modified programmatically.  It may disappear in the
future if Apple fixes the default behavior (based on
Xcode 8.1 release notes, this is a known issue filed
as rdar://28670596).

Note that this is only in the header for the sake of
Interface Builder, which will not synchronize with
changes to an interface declared in a ".mm" file.
